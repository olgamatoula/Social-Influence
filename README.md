# Social-Influence

This is my solution for a university project called "Social Influence". 

In this project we were called to create a Player, who would be able to influence most nodes in a graph with their opinion.

It is emplemented in Java and applies algorithms, such as PageRank, Dijkstra's, as well as Graph Theory principles, such as centralities.
